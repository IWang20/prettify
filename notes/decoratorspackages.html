    <h1><div align=center>                Decorators</div></h1>
<hr />
<h2><a name="top"></a> Table of Contents</h2>
<hr />
<p>We have discussed decorators before. Typically we described them as a class
that takes an argument that supports some protocol (methods) and returns an
object that supports the same protocol (methods). When the decorator object
executes these methods, it performs a bit differently than for the decorated
object. The decorator object typically stores a reference to the decorated
object and calls it when necessary.</p>
<p>The examples in this lecture, and the Check_Annotations class in Programming
Assignment #4, use classes to decorate functions by using the __call__ protocol
to decorate/augment how functions are called. Although, some examples don't
need classes (and just use functions) to do the decoration.</p>
<p>Finally, it is appropriate to put this material right after our discussion
of recursion and functional programming. Decorating function calls is most
interesting when the functions are called many times. And, one call to a
recursive function results in it calling itself many times.</p>
<p>We will use the recursive factorial and fib (Fibonacci) functions in our
examples below. Both require an argument &gt;= 0.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n\*factorial(n-1)

def fib(n):
    if    n == 0: return 1
    elif  n == 1: return 1
    else:         return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
</code></pre></div>

<hr />
<p>Special Python Syntax for Decorators</p>
<p>If Decorator is the name of a decorator (a class or a function) that takes one
argument, we can use it to decorate a function object, by writing either</p>
<p>def f(params-annotation) -&gt; result-annotation:
      ...
  f = Decorator(f)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>@Decorator
  def f(params-annotation) -&gt; result-annotation:</p>
<p>which has the same meaning. We can also use multiple decorators on functions.
The meaning of</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nd">@Decorator1</span>
<span class="nd">@Decorator2</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>is equivalent to writing</p>
<p>f = Decorator1(Decorator2(f))</p>
<p>so Decorator1 decorates the result of Decorator2 decorating f; the decorators
are applied in the reverse of the order they appear (with the closest one to
the decorated object applying first).</p>
<p>There is a decorator name staticmethod which we have used to decorate methods
defined in classes: those methods that don't have a self parameter. Currently
Eclipse marks these as syntax errors (methods with no self parameter) but still
runs the code correctly. By using the staticmethod decorator, the syntax error
disappears.</p>
<hr />
<p>Examples of Function Decorators</p>
<p>Here are three decorators for functions (three are classes; some can be written
easily as functions too).</p>
<p>(1) Track_Calls remembers the function it is decorating and initializes the
calls counter to 0; the decorator object overloads the __call__ method so that
all calls to the decorator object increment its calls counter and then actually
calls the decorated function (which if recursive, increments the calls counter
for every recursive call). Once the function's value is computed and returned,
the calls counter instance name can be accessed (via called) and reset (via
reset) for tracking further calls.</p>
<p>class Track_Calls:
    def __init__(self,f):
        self.f = f
        self.calls = 0</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>def \_\_call\_\_(self,\*args,\*\*kargs):  # bundle arbitrary arguments
    self.calls += 1
    return self.f(\*args,\*\*kargs)   # unbundle arbitrary arguments

def called(self):
    return self.calls

def reset\_calls(self):
    self.calls = 0
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, if we wrote</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nd">@Track_Calls</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
         <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>then factorial would refer to a Track_Calls object, whose self.f refers to the
actual function object factorial defined and whose self.calls is 0.</p>
<p>If we called factorial(3), Python executes the factorial.__call__(3) method on
the factorial object, which would increment factorial.calls and then call
factorial.f(3) - the original factorial function object: its body would
recursively call factorial(2), which Python executes as factorial.__call__(2).</p>
<p>This process continues, ultimately factorial.__call__(3) returns 6 with
factorial.calls = 4. We have seen before that factorial(n) calls itself for
n, n-1, n-2, ... 0 for a total of n+1 times.</p>
<p>Examine the picture accompanying this lecture, showing the Fibonacci function
(whose body does two recursive calls) and all the recursive calls it generates
when called with a variety of numbers. Ignore the colors for now.For example
calling fib(2) does a total of 3 calls to fib (counting itself), fib(3) does a
total of 5 calls, fib(4) does a total of 9 calls, fib(5) does a total of 15
calls, fib(6) does a total of 25 calls. We can use Track_Calls to verify these
numbers (and compute fib for bigger numbers). For example fib(10) = 89 does a
total of 177 calls fib(20) = 10,946 and does a total of 21,891 calls.</p>
<p>Run the program accompanying this lecture to see the value (and number of
function calls) needed to evaluate fib(0) through fib(30). Notice that the last
few calculations take a noticable amount of time: computing fib(30) requires
2,692,537 function calls!</p>
<p>We can write this decorator as the following function instead</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">track_calls</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kargs</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">call</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">calls</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kargs</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">call</span>.<span class="nv">calls</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>         # <span class="nv">define</span> <span class="nv">calls</span> <span class="nv">attribute</span> <span class="nv">on</span> <span class="k">call</span> <span class="nl">function</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">object</span>
<span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">call</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here we define an inner-function call, which is returned by track_calls. Before
returning this function object, a calls instance name is defined for that object
and initialzed to 0; inside the call function that instance name is incremented
before the original function (f) is called and the value it computes returned.</p>
<p>I will continue to show equivalent class/function definitions for the decorators
described below, but at the end I will briefly explain the reason for using
classes instead of functions: the ability to overload the __getattr__ function
for using multiple decorators at the same time.</p>
<hr />
<p>(2) Memoize remembers the function it is decorating and initializes a dict to
{}. It will use this dict to cache (keep track of and be able to access quickly)
the arguments to calls and the value ultimately returned by the function. The
decorator object overloads the __call__ method so that all calls to the
decorator object first check to see if the arguments are already cached in the
dict, and if so their associated value is returned immediately, without
executing the code in the decorated function; if not the decorated function is
called, its answer is cached in the dict with the function's arguments, and the
answer is returned. </p>
<p>For simplicity here, I'm assuming all arguments are positional (so no **kargs).
Also,since the arguments are used as keys in a dictionary, they must be
immutable/hashable.</p>
<p>In this way, a function never has to compute the same value twice. Memoization
is useful for multiply recursive calls, as in the fibonacci function.</p>
<p>class Memoize:
    def __init__(self,f):
        self.f = f
        self.cache = {}</p>

<p>Examine the picture accompanying this lecture, showing the Fibonacci function.
When decorated by Memoize, the only calls that actually compute a result are
those in green. As each green function calls finishes, it caches its result in
the dictionary. Afterward, calling fib with that argument again will obtain the
result from the cache immediately (all the calls in white). With memoization,
calling fib(n) does a total of n+1 function calls.</p>
<p>Run the program accompanying this lecture to see the value (and number of
function calls) needed to evaluate fib(0) through fib(30). This time, uncomment
@Memoize and the fib.reset_cache() call in the loop. Notice that all the
calculations are done instantaneously: with memoization, computing fib(30)
requires only 31 function calls (with cached values computed immediately
billions of times).</p>
<p>We can also write memoize as a function, to return a wrapper function (it can
be named anything) that does the same operations as the class above. Note that
cache, a name local to memoize, is used in wrapper but not accessible outside
wrapper (unlike what we did with call.calls above)</p>

<hr />
<p>(3) Illustrate_Recursive remembers the function it is decorating and
initializes a tracing variable to False. The decorator object overloads the
__call__ method so that all calls to the decorator object just return the
result of calling the decorated function (if tracing is off). Calling
.illustrate(...) on the decorator calls the illustrate method, which sets up
for tracing, and then uses __call__ to trace all entrances and exists to the
decorated function printing indented/outdented information for each function
call/return.</p>

<p>The fib function is NOT a linear recursive function: its body contains two
recursive calls. So the structure of its recursion is more complicated. This is
why thefib function is a good one to test both Track_Calls and Memoize. Even
for fairly small arguments (under 30), it produces a tremendous number of calls
and can be sped-up tremendously by memoizing it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Delegation of attribute lookup</p>
<p>When using (multiple) decorators, we need a way to translate attribute accesses
on the decorator into attribute accesses on the decorated. There is no simple
mechanism to do this with functions, but it easy to do with classes: by
overloading the __getattr__ method as follows (which should be done to all three
classes above).</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>def \_\_getattr\_\_(self,attr):        # if attr not here, try self.f
    return getattr(self.f,attr)
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, if we use the following two decorators</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">@Track</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="n">_Calls</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nv">@Illustrate</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="n">_Recursive</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(....)</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">...</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>fib is a Track_Calls object, whose .f attribute is an Illustrate_Recursive 
object whose .f attribute is the actual fib function. If we then wrote
fib.illustrate(5) Python would try to find the illustrate attribute of the
Track_Calls object; there is no such attribute there, so it fails and then
calls the __getattr__ of the Track_Calls class, which "translates" the failed
attribute access into getting the same attribute from the .f object (from the
decorated class object, an object of the Illustrate_Recursive class, which does
define such an attribute, as a method which can be called).</p>
<p>Generally this is called delegation: where an "outer" object that does not have
some attribute delegates the attribute reference to an inner object. Decorators
often use exactly this form of delegation, so the decorator object can process
its attributes and all the attributes of the decorated object.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now we will study an interesting combination of using decorators and the
functools.partial function (discussed in the previous lecture). Let's look at
the following simple decorator, which takes a function and its name as
arguments; every time the function is called the decorator prints the
function's name and the result it computes.</p>
<p>class Trace:
    def __init__(self,f,f_name):
        self.f = f
        self.f_name = f_name</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>def \_\_call\_\_(self,\*args,\*\*kargs):
    result = self.f(\*args,\*\*kargs)
    print(self.f\_name+&#39;called: &#39;+str(result))
    return result
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now suppose we want to decorate a function f defined simple as</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we write</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nd">@Trace</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Python raises a TypeError exception, because the __init__ for Trace requires
two arguments, not one. We can avoid the @ form of decorators and write</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>

<p>to solve the problem, but without using the @Decorator form. Can we do something
to use this form. The problem is that we have have two arguments to __init__ but
@Decorator requires just one, so we can use functools.partial to pre-supply the
second argument.</p>
<p>We can write</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">f_Trace</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">functools</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">partial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Trace</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">f_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;f&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nd">@f_Trace</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But even that is a bit clunky, because we are defining the name f_Trace but
using it only once (we are not likely to trace other functions named f). We
don't need this name; instead we can write</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nd">@functools</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">partial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Trace</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">f_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;f&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>directly using the result returned from partial as the decorator. This allows
us to use the standard @Decorator form (with possibly more than one decorator).</p>
<p>Now calling f(1) would return the result 2 and cause Python to print</p>
<p>f called: 2</p>
<hr />
<p>Problems:</p>
<p>1) Define a class that decorates function calls so that it keeps count of how
many times the function was called with each combination of arguments. Write
a report function that returns a list of 2-tuples, each containing the argument
and the number of times the function was called with that argument, sorted from
the most freqeuently to least frequently called argument).  Hint: this is
similar to what Track_Calls and Memoize does.</p>
<p>2) Define a Memoize class whose constructor also has a max_to_remember argument,
which limits the size of the dict to that number of entries (if the argument is
None, memoize all calls in the ditc). It should remember only the most recent
max_to_remember arguments. Hint: do this by keeping a list (really representing
a queue with oldest and youngest values) and a dict in synch as follows:
  (a) if the args are IN the dict, just return the result.
  (b) if the args are NOT IN the dict, and the list HAS ROOM, add the args to
         the list (at the end: youngest) and to the dict (with their computed
         value)
  (c) if the args are NOT IN the dict, and the list has NO MORE ROOM, pops the
         value out of index 0 (oldest) in the list and delete that as a key from
         the dict, then add the args to the list (at the end) and to the dict
         (with their computed value) 
Finally, write a function that returns a 4-tuple containing the number of hits
(times the function was callled on memoized arguments), misses (times the
function was callled on arguments that weren't memoized), the current size of
the list/dict, and the maximum size.</p>
