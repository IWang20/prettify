<p>This lecture reviews basic material that you should know about defining and
using classes, although it also presents some new (hopefully easy to understand)
material that you may have not seen. Primarily this lecture discusses how to
use the namespaces in class objects and their instance objects to store data as
well as functions/methods.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="anchor-1"></a>Defining Classes</h2>
<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]</p>
<p>When we define a class in a Python, we are binding the class name to an object
representing the entire class. We call the class object to create a new object
that is an instance of the class: Python constructs an empty instance object
and then calls the ___init__ method defined in the class, (passing the new/empty
instance object to the self parameter) to initialize the state of the instance
object. Recall that all names in Python refer/are-bound to objects; so defining</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>   <span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">C:</span>
       ...
</pre></div>


<p>creates the name C and binds it to an object representing the class C.</p>
<p>What names are attributes defined in a class object's namespace? I'm not
talking about the instance objects that will be constructed from the class C,
but the names in the namespace of the class object itself. Mostly, a class
defines names that are bound to its methods (__init__, etc.), but later in this
lecture we will discuss names representing class variables as well as class
methods.</p>
<p>When we want to construct an object that is an instance of a class, we refer to
a class object (typically by a name bound to it) followed by () and possibly
arguments in these parentheses. Python does three things when constructing new
instance objects:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It calls a special function that creates an object that is a new instance of
    the class. Note that this object automatically has an dictionary associated
     with it, with the name __dict__, but that dictionary starts empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It calls the __init__ method for the class, passing the object created in
    (1) to the first/self parameter of __init__ , and following this with all
    the other argument values in the parentheses used in the call to construct
    the state of this instance. Typically it assigns values to self/instance
    variables, storing the name/binding in __dict__ for the self object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reference to the object that was created in (1) and initialized in (2) is
    returned as the result of constructing the object: most likely this
    reference will be bound to a name: e.g., c = C(...) which means c refers to
    a newly constructed/initialized object of class C.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So if we call c = C(1,2) Python calls C.__init__(reference to new object,1,2)
and binds c to refer to the newly constructed object somehow initialized by
1 and 2.</p>
<p>Note that we can define other names that can bind to/share the same class
object. For example:</p>
<p>class C:
        def <strong>init</strong>(self):
            print('instance of C object initialized')
            self.m = 'starting' # initialize an instance/attribute name</p>
<p>D = C   # C and D share the same class object
x = C() # Use C to construct an instance of a class C object
y = D() # Use D to construct an instance of a class C object</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">C</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">D</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">C</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Running this script produces the following: the first two lines from calling
__init__ twice, the next two from calling the two print statements above</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  instance of C object initialized
  instance of C object initialized
  &lt;class &#39;__main__.C&#39;&gt; &lt;class &#39;__main__.C&#39;&gt; &lt;__main__.C object at 0x027B0E10&gt; &lt;__main__.C object at 0x02889C50&gt;
  &lt;class &#39;__main__.C&#39;&gt; &lt;class &#39;__main__.C&#39;&gt; &lt;class &#39;type&#39;&gt; &lt;class &#39;type&#39;&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, if we print(x.m) or print(y.m) it prints 'starting'</p>
<p>We can use the type function to determine the type of any object. The objects x
and y refer to are instances of the class C, defined in the main script. C (and
all classes that we define) are instances of a special class called 'type'). So
x is an instance of C, and C is an instance of 'type'.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="anchor-2"></a>Manipulating an object's namespace (and <strong>init</strong>)</h2>
<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]</p>
<p>All objects have namespaces, which are dictionaries in which names defined in
that object are bound-to/associated-with values. Typically we write something
like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span>
</pre></div>


<p>in the __init__ or any other method, to defined a name in the dictionary of the
object self refers to, and bind that name (or update an exsting binding) to
refer to value.</p>
<p>Now we illustrate a cruder way to add names to the namespace of an object.
This way is not recommended now, but it furthers our understanding of objects
and their namespaces in Python, and we will find concrete uses for this
understanding later. Given class C defined above, we can write</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__dict__</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;two&#39;</span>
<span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__dict__</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;z&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__dict__</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Running this script produces</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  instance of C object initialized
  {&#39;m&#39;: &#39;starting&#39;}
  {&#39;x&#39;: 1, &#39;y&#39;: &#39;two&#39;, &#39;m&#39;: &#39;starting&#39;, &#39;z&#39;: 3}
  starting 1 two 3
</pre></div>


<p>So, we have used two different forms for adding three names to the
namespace/dictionary for the object that c refers to (which initially stores
the name m, initialized by self.m = 'starting'). Adding names updates the
object's __dict__.  Writing object.name = value is equivalent to writing
object.__dict__['name'] = value.</p>
<p>The object c has a __dict__ attribute that stores its namespace bindings.
Each identifier for which we define an attribute for the object appears as a
string keyword in __dict__.</p>
<p>Generally we don't initialize the namespace of an object this way; instead we
use the automatically-called __init__ method and its self parameter to do the
initialization. But really, the same thing is happening in __init__ below as
was shown above.</p>
<p>class C:
        def <strong>init</strong>(self,init<em>x,init</em>y):
            print('instance of C object initialized')
            self.x = init<em>x     # value depends on the argument matching init</em>x
            self.y = init<em>y     # value depends on the argument matching init</em>y
            self.z = 3      # always the same object: 3</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;two&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span>\<span class="n">_</span>\<span class="n">_dict</span>\<span class="n">_</span>\<span class="n">_</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Running this script produces the same results.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  instance of C object initialized
  {&#39;z&#39;: 3, &#39;y&#39;: &#39;two&#39;, &#39;x&#39;: 1}
</pre></div>


<p>The purpose of the __init__ method is to create all the attribute names needed
by the object's methods and initializes them appropriately. Typically, once
__init__ is called, no new names are added to the object's namespace (although
Python allows additions, as illustrated in the prior section (c.x = 1) and some
useful examples are illustrated later in this lecture as well). Every object
constructed is likely to need exactly the same names: all the names used
in the methods defined in the class; methods that process instance objects
of the class. The __init__ method, which is automatically called by Python
when an object is constructed, is a convenient place to localize the creation
and initialization of all these attribute names.</p>
<p>So, for every assignment statement</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Python puts an entry into the object's namespace (self.__dict_) with the key
'name' (keys are strings) associated with value. We can do this in the __init__
method or after the object is constructed: both ways are shown above. When
self.name appears in an expression (e.g., a = self.name), Python substitutes the
expression self.__dict__['name'] for the right hand side of the =, to retrieve
the value of that name from the self object's namespace/dictionary.</p>
<p>If we try to access a non-existent attribute name (c.mumble in the class C
above, which is translated into c.__dict__['mumble']), Python raises an
exception. print(c.mumble) prints the exception as</p>
<p>AttributeError: 'C' object has no attribute 'mumble'</p>
<p>Note that some names defined in __init__ (z above) always receive the same
initialization, so we don't need a parameter to initialize them. But often
names need to be initialized to different values when different objects are
constructed, so typically we add just enough parameters to the __init__  method
to allow us to specify how those names with different values should be
initialized.</p>
<hr />
<p>Interlude: assert in initialization</p>
<p>Sometimes __init__ will ensure that a parameter is matched to an argument that
stores a legal and reasonable value for it; if not, Python will raise an
exception to indicate that the object being constructed cannot be properly
initialized. Sometimes it raises an exception explicitly, using an if statement
that tests for an illegal value. Sometimes it uses an assert statement for this
purpose. Remember that the form of assert is:</p>
<p>assert boolean-test, string</p>
<p>which is equivalent to the slightly more verbose</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  if not boolean-test:
      raise AssertionError(string)
</pre></div>


<p>I suggest that the string argument to AssertionError should always contain 4
parts:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  (1) The name of the class (if the problem occurs in the method of a class) or
      the name of the module (if the problem occurs in a function in a module)
</pre></div>


<p>(2) The name of the method/function that detects the problem (here __init__)</p>
<p>(3) A short description of the problem...</p>
<p>(4) ...including the values of the argument(s) that is causing the problem</p>
<p>For example, if class C included an  __init__ method that required x's argument
to be a positive integer, we could write __init__ as follows. We typically check
all the arguments FIRST in this method, before binding any self/instance names.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  def __init__(self,x):
      assert type(x) is int and x &gt; 0, &#39;C.__init__: x(&#39;+str(x)+&#39;) must be an int and positive&#39;
      ...
</pre></div>


<p>or</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  def __init__(self,x):
      assert type(x) is int and x &gt; 0, &#39;C.__init__: x({v}) must be an int and positive&#39;.format(v=x)
      ...
</pre></div>


<p>If so, calling C(-1) would result in the error message</p>
<p>C.__init__: x(-1) must be an int and positive</p>
<p>and calling C('abc') would result in the error message</p>
<p>C.__init__: x(abc) must be an int and positive</p>
<p>Such a message provides useful information to whoever is writing/debugging the
program. In a well-written program, someone just using the program (possible
not a programer) should not have to read/interpret such a message.</p>
<p>Question: if we wrote the assert as just x &gt; 0, what exception would be raised
by calling C('abc') and why? Why is the given assertion "better", even though it
is less efficient to check?</p>
<p>We could be even more descriptive and write
      def <strong>init</strong>(self,x):
          assert type(x) is int, 'C.<strong>init</strong>: x('{v}') must be an int'.format(v=x)
          assert x &gt; 0, 'C.<strong>init</strong>: x({v}) must be positive'.format(v=x)</p>
<p>Note that int refers to the int class (not an instance of an int class: e.g.,
not 1), so writing "type(x) is int" is checking whether the type of the object
x refers to is the same as the object int refers to: meaning x is bound to an
object constructed from the int class.</p>
<hr />
<p>Once an object is constructed and initialized, typically we use it by calling
methods (or possibly passing it to another function/method that calls its
methods). We call an object's method using the syntax object.method(arguments);
recall the Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>o.m(...) is translated into type(o).m(o,...)
</pre></div>


<p>This means, the method m in the class specifying the type of object o is called,
and the object o used to call the method is passed to the method as the first
argument (matching the self parameter). For example, 'a;b;c'.split(';') is
translated into type('a;b;c').split('a;b;c',';') which is equivalent to
str.split('a;b;c',';'). It calls the split method defined in the str class with
the arguments 'a;b;c' (matching the self parameter) and ';' (matching the
second parameter).</p>
<p>Before finishing the discussion of objects and their dictionaries, recall that
C refers to a class object. As an object, it also has a __dict__ that stores its
namespace. Here is some code that shows what names are defined in the C object.</p>
<p>for (k,v) in C.__dict__.items():
    print(k,'-&gt;',v)</p>
<p>And here is what it prints.</p>
<p>__weakref__ -&gt; <attribute '\_\_weakref\_\_' of 'C' objects>
__dict__ -&gt; <attribute '\_\_dict\_\_' of 'C' objects>
__doc__ -&gt; None
__init__ -&gt; <function C.\_\_init\_\_ at 0x03197618>
__qualname__ -&gt; C
__module__ -&gt; __main__</p>
<p>Note that __init__ is the only function that we defined, and it is there (on
the 4th line). Because I ran this code as a script (the main module), its
__module__ variable is bound to '__main__', which you should know something
about, because you should have written (and understand) code like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__module__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If this module were imported, the __module__ key would be associated with the
file/module name it was written in, when imported.  Only the module
corresponding to the script that started execution has its __module__ key bound
to '__main__'. We can test this name to run the script only when its module is
run, not when it is imported by another module. The if accomplishes this
behavior.</p>
<p>If I had defined C with a docstring it would appear as an attribute of __doc__.
Don't worry about __weakref__, the internal __dict__ or __qualname__.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="anchor-3"></a>Different kinds of names: definition and use</h2>
<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]</p>
<p>Let's discuss four different kinds of names in relation to classes. We will
call all these names variables.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  (1) local variables: defined and used inside functions/methods to help with
      the computation; parameter variables are considered local variables too.

  (2) instance variables of an object: typically defined inside __init__ and
      used inside class methods (we saw other ways to define them above too).
      These are referred to as self.name.

  (3) class variables: typically defined in classes (at same level as methods,
      not inside methods) and typically used in methods; we use a class
      variable for information COMMON to all objects of a class (rather than
      putting the same local variable in each object constructed from the
      class). Methods are actually class variables, bound to function objects.

      All class variables are defined in the class object and they are found by
      the Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented Programming through instances
      of that class. That is, if class C defines an attribute a (method or
      class variable) and x refers to an object constructed from class C, then
      x.a will find attribut a in class C, but only if it is not stored
      directly in x (in x&#39;s __dict__). For class variables, that is typically
      what we want.

  (4) global variables: typically defined in modules (outside of functions and
      classes) and used inside functions and/or class methods; we typically
      avoid using them (don&#39;t use global variables), and when we do use them,
      we do so in a cautious and limited manner.
</pre></div>


<p>You should know how to use all these kinds of variables (and their semantics).
Use local variables and instance variables as needed (most function/methods
have the former, and most classes define the later in __init__ and use them in
methods). Class variables are sometimes useful to solve certain kinds of
problems where common information is stored among all the instances, by storing
them just once in their common class object. Global variables are fine to use in
scripts, but are often frowned upon when declared in modules that are imported
(although they too have their uses there, but in more advanced settings).</p>
<p>The following script uses each kind of variable, appropriately named. Ensure
that you understand how each use of these variables works. The use of the
command named 'global' (see the two lines with #comments) is explained in more
detail below.</p>

<p>prints

      y bumped
      instance referred to by y : global<em>var = 3 /class</em>var = 3 /instance_var= 21</p>

<p>prints
      instance referred to by x : global<em>var = 3 /class</em>var = 3 /instance<em>var= 12
      instance referred to by x : global</em>var = 3 /class<em>var = 3 /instance</em>var= 12</p>
<p>print(C.class_var, x.class_var)  # discussed below
print(x.instance_var)</p>
<p>prints
      3 3
      12</p>
<p>So, the global variable is changing every time, as is the class variable,
because there is just one of each. But each object thta is an instance of C
has its own instance variable, which changes only when bump is called on that
instance.</p>
<p>If we instead commented as follows</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>        global_var = 100     # comment out this line or the next
        #global global_var   # comment out this line or the previous
</pre></div>


<p>running the script would have the following result: By removing the statement
global global_var, then the statement global_var = 100 actually defines a local
variable in the bump method -despite its name- so its increment does not affect
the true global_var, which stays at zero.</p>
<p>Recall, if a variable defined in a function/method has not been declared global,
it is created as a local variable inside the function/procedure.</p>
<p>Note that one can REFER to the value of a global_var inside methods of class C
WITHOUT a global declaration (see the report method), but if a method wants to
CHANGE global_var it must declare it global (then all reference and changes are
to the real global variable). With no global global_var, the assignment
global_var = 100 creates a new name local to the bump method and always binds
it to 100.</p>

<p>Finally, it is clear what C.class_var and x.instance_var refer to, but what
about x.class_var? As shown above this prints 1 just as C.class_var does. This
meaning is a result of the Fundamental Equation of Object Oriented Programming
(but applied to variable attributes, not method attributes).</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>-----
Technically, when specifying o.attr, any access to an attribute name in object o
(whether a variable or method) Python first tries to find attr in the object o;
if it is not defined in o&#39;s namespace/__dict__ Python uses the FEOOP to try to
find it by checking type(o).attr, which attempts to find attr in type(o)&#39;s
namespace/__dict__. So when trying to find x.class_var if fails to find
class_var in o&#39;s namespace/__dict__, so it tries type(o).class_var or
C.class_var and finds the class_var attribute in C&#39;s namespace/__dict__.
</pre></div>


<p>When we study inheritance, we will learn more about how Python searches for
all attributes by generalizing this rule: if it is not in an instance, then it
tries in the class that instance was constructed from, and if not in that
class, it tries in its super classes, and if not in its superclass....</p>
<p>But for now remember: to find an attribute, look first in the namespace of the
object; if it isn't there, then look in the namespace of the class thta the
object was constructed from.</p>

<h2><a name="anchor-4"></a>Strange Python (but now understandable)</h2>
<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]
  1) Defining/using a method for a class, AFTER the class has been declared:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  2) Defining a method for an instance (but not the whole class) after the
       instance has been constructed:
</pre></div>


<p>We will now discuss one more interesting thing a dynamic language like Python
can do (but languages like Java and C++ cannot). We can change the meaning of
a class as a program is running. Let's go back to a very simple class C, that
stores one instance variable, but has no methods that change it. The report
method prints the value of this instance variable.</p>
<p>class C:
        def <strong>init</strong>(self,init<em>instance</em>var):
            self.instance<em>var = init</em>instance_var</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>    def report(self,var_name):
        print(&#39;instance referred to by&#39;, var_name,
              &#39;/instance_var=&#39;, self.instance_var)
</pre></div>


<p>Now look at the following code. It defines x to refer to an object constructed
from the class C, which defines only a report method (and then it calls that
method to report). Next it defines the bump function with a  first parameter
named self: its body increments the instance_var in self's namespace
dictionary. We call bump with x and it updates x's instance_var (as seen by the
report).</p>
<p>Then we do something strange. We add the bump function into the namespace of
C's class object with the name cbump (that is just the same as writing
C.__dict__['cbump'] = bump, creating the cbump method). We could have used just
bump, but instead used a slightly different name. Then, we call x.cbump('x')
which by the Fundamental Equation of OOP is the same as calling C.cbump(x,'x')
and because we just made the cbump attribute of the object representing class C
refer to the bump function, its meaning is to call the same function object
that bump refers to.</p>

<p>prints

</pre></div>


<p>prints
      y bumped
      instance referred to by y /instance_var= 21</p>
<p>So, even after the class C has been defined, we can still add a method to it 
namespace and then can call it using any object that has already been (or will
be) constructed from the class C. That is, we can change the meaning of a class
C, and all the objects constructed from the class will respond to the change
through the FEOOP.</p>
<p>Recall that the del command gets rid of an association in a dict. If we wrote
del C.cbump, then if we tried to call that method by x.cbump('x') the result
would be that Python raises </p>
<p>AttributeError: 'C' object has no attribute 'cbump'</p>
<p>So we can both ADD and REMOVE names from a class object's namespace!</p>
<p>Note that we could have defined/written bump as follows (note use of p not self
as the first parameter of bump)</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span>  <span class="nf">bump</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;bumped&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">instance_var</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and nothing changes, so long as every occurrence of self is changed to p inside
the bump function (as is done). We could likewise write</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">report</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>inside the C class itself. The parameter name self is just the standard name 
used in Python code; but there is nothing magical about this name, and we can
substitute whatever name we want for the first parameter. This parameter will
be matched with the object used to call the method. Although any name is
allowed, I strongly recommend always following Python's convention and using
the name self. Eclipse always supplies the name self automatically as the first
parameter to any methods we define.</p>
<hr />
<p>Defining a method for an instance (but not the whole class) after the
  instance has been constructed:</p>
<p>In fact, Python also allows us to add a reference to the bump method to a single
instance of an object constructed from class C, not the class itself. Therefore
unlike the example above, bump is callable only on that one object it was
added to, not on all the other instances of that class. We can also use this
technique to add a method to an object that is different than the one defined
in the object's class.</p>
<p>Start with the class C as defined above, defining just __init__ and report.
Then</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">bump</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>y.bump(y,'y')     # fails because there is no bump attribute in the object y
y.report('y')     #    refers to, either directly in y or in y's class C</p>
<p>Note that calling x.bump(..) finds the bump method in x's namespace, without
needing to translate it using the Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented
Programming. Without the translation, we explicitly need to pass the x argument
which becomes bump's self parameter.</p>
<p>Generally when looking up the attribute x.attr (whether attr is a variable or
method name), Python first looks in the namespace of the object x refers to,
and if it doesn't find attr, it next looks in the namespace of the object
type(x) refers to.</p>
<p>When run, this script produces:</p>
<p>x bumped
x bumped
instance referred to by  x /instance_var= 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "C:\Users\pattis\Desktop\python32\test\script.py", line 21, in <module>
        y.bump(y,'y')     # fails because there is no bump attribute in the object y
    AttributeError: 'C' object has no attribute 'bump'</p>
<p>The error message mentions C because after failing to find the bump attribute
in the object y refers to, it looks in the object C refers to; when it fails
there too, the raised exception reports the error.</p>
<p>So, we can add methods to</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  (a) classes: methods that all the instances of that class can refer to, via
      FEEOP

  (b) an instance of the class, such that only that instance can call the method
      (and their self parameter must also be passed as an explicit argument),
      since FEOOP is not used.
</pre></div>


<hr />
<p>Combining both worlds using delegation</p>
<p>Suppose that we wanted to be able to call methods attached to objects, but do
so using the standard object.method(...) syntax, as we did in the first part of
this section. In the second part of this section, we had to duplicate the
object, e.g., calling x.bump(x,'x') instead of just x.bump('x'). We will see
how to return to this simpler behavior using the concept of delegation in
Python.</p>
<p>We start by defining C as follows, adding the bump function below</p>
<p>class C:
        def <strong>init</strong>(self,init<em>instance</em>var):
            self.instance<em>var = init</em>instance_var</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>    def report(self,var):
        print(&#39;instance referred to by&#39;, var,
              &#39;/instance_var=&#39;, self.instance_var)

    def bump(self,name):
        try:
            self.object_bump(self,name)
        except AttributeError:
            print(&#39;could not bump&#39;,name) # or just pass to handle the exception;
                                         # or omit try/except altogther
</pre></div>


<p>In this definition of C, there is a bump method defined in the class C, for all
instances constructed from this class to execute, findable by FEEOP.</p>
<p>When bump is called here, it tries to call a method named object_bump on the
instance it was supplied, passing the object itself to object_bump (doing
explicitly what FEOOP does implicitly/automatically). If that instance defines
an object_bump function, it is executed; if not, Python raises an attribute
exception, which at present prints a message, but if replaced by pass would
just silently fail. Of course, we could also remove the entire try/except so an
attribute failure would raise an exception and stop execution.</p>
<p>Note that in the call x.bump(...) Python uses the Fundamental Equation of OOP
to translate this call into C.bump(x,'x'), which calls the equivalent of
x.object_bump(x,'x').</p>
<p>In the world of programming, this is called delegation (which we will see more
of): the bump method delegates to the object_bump method (if present) to get
its work done.</p>
<p>Here is a script, using this class. It attaches different object_bump methods
to the instance x refers to, and the instance y refers to, but not to the
instance z refers to (nor to the class C). It calls this object_bump method not
directly, but through delegation by calling bump in the C class.</p>

<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]</p>
<p>Note that we can redefine a function or class. For example, we can write</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Calling f() would return 1. Eclipse gets upset about this, and marks the
second definition as an error (duplicate signature), but there is nothing
technically wrong with this code (although the first definition is useless,
and there may be a mistake in the spelling of one of these functions). Python
will run the script. We can also write the following script, which Eclipse
won't complain about, and runs the same.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">g</span><span class="p">():</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">g</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Calling f() returns 1. Again, def just makes a name refer to a function object;
if, as in the case of the two definitions of the f name above, the name already
refers to an object, the binding of f is just changed to refer to the function
object g refers to.</p>
<p>Conceptually, it is no different than writing x = 1 and then x = 2 (changing
what x refers to from the int object 1 to the int object 2).</p>
<p>We can do the same thing for classes, as we saw with the names C and D in the
first example in these notes.</p>
<p>In summary, def f or class C just define a name and binds it to a function/class
object. We can call the function or the class's constructor. We can rebind that
name later to any other object. We can even write</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now f is bound to an int instance object, not a function object.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="anchor-6"></a>Accessor/Mutator Methods (or query/command methods) and Instance Variables</h2>
<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]
  ...single/double underscore prefix</p>
<p>If calling o.method(...) returns information about an o's state but does not
change o's state, it is called an accessor (or query). If o.method(...) changes
o's state and returns None (all functions/methods must return some value), it
is called a mutator (or command). Some method calls do both: they change o's
state but also return a non-None value.</p>
<p>A design question arises. Suppose that we know that an object o of a class C
has an instance variable name iv: should we directly refer to o.iv? Should we
use its value by writing o.iv or change it by writing o.iv = ....? The high
road says, no: a class should hide the actual instance variables from the
clients/users of the class; they should provide methods to manipulate the
objects under control of the class. What instance variables we need to
implement a class might change over time, but the methods that define the
behavior of objects created from that class should stay the same and always
work correctly with whatever instance variables we are using.</p>
<p>Python is a bit at odds with this philosophy. Some languages (Java/C++) have a
mechanism whereby instance variables can be tagged PRIVATE, so that they are
accessible only from methods defined in the class itself; these languages do
not allow new instance variables nor methods to be added dynamically to objects
as Python does (as we showed above).</p>
<p>Python's philosophy is a bit more open to accessing instance variables outside
of the class methods. But there is danger in doing so, and beginners often use
this convenience and end up taking longer to get their code to work correctly,
and also make it harder to understand and change the code, because they are
accessing information that is not guaranteed to be there in future changes to
the code.</p>
<p>In fact, Python does have a weaker form of tagging PRIVATE names, which we can
use for names that should not be referred to outside the methods in the
object's class. Below we explain the meaning of instance variable names that
begin with one or two underscores (but don't have two trailing underscores, so
are unlike __init__).</p>
<hr />
<p>Single Underscore: </p>
<p>When a programmer uses a single underscore in a name in a class (for data or a
method), he/she is indicating  that the name should NOT BE ACCESSED outside of
the methods in the class. But, there is nothing in the Python interpreter that
stops anyone from accessing that name. We can use this convention for private
data and helper methods.</p>
<p>class C:
        def <strong>init</strong>(self):
            self._mv = 1</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">_f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_mv</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

<span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span>  <span class="n">C</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span>\<span class="n">_mv</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span>\<span class="n">_f</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When run, this script produces: 1 True</p>
<p>Still, if a class is written with names prefixed by a single underscore, it
indicates that objects constructed from that class should not access those
names outside of the methods defined inside the class.</p>
<hr />
<p>Double Underscore:</p>
<p>If a Python name in a class begins with two underscores, it can be referred to
by that name in the class, but not easily outside the class: but it can still be
referred to outside the class, but with a "mangled" name that includes the name
of the class. If a class C defines a name __mv then the name outside the class
can be referred to as _C__mv. This is called a "mangled" name.</p>
<p>So, if we changed the code in the class C above by writing _mv as __mv and _f as
__f, and tried to execute</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span>  <span class="n">C</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span>\<span class="n">_</span>\<span class="n">_mv</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span>\<span class="n">_</span>\<span class="n">_f</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Python would complain by raising an AttributeError exception for the first
value in the print statement</p>
<p>AttributeError: 'C' object has no attribute '__mv'</p>
<p>It x.__mv was remove, Python would complain about x.__f(), indicating the
object has no attribute '__f'.  </p>
<p>But given class C defines __mv, and __f we could execute the following code</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span>  <span class="n">C</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span>\<span class="n">_C</span>\<span class="n">_</span>\<span class="n">_mv</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span>\<span class="n">_C</span>\<span class="n">_</span>\<span class="n">_f</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>


<p>by writing the mangled names. When we run this script it again produces: 1 True</p>
<p>In fact, if we printed the dictionary for x, it would show '_C__mv' as a key,
which is the true name of these functions outside of the module.</p>
<p>print(x.__dict__) would print: {'_C__mv': 1}</p>
<p>So, Python does contain two conventions for hiding names: the first (one
underscore) is purely suggestive; the second (two underscores) actually makes
it harder to refer to such names outside of a class.</p>
<p>But neither truly prohibits accessing the information by referring to the name.</p>
<p>When we discuss operator overloading (later this week) and inheritance (later
in the quarter) we will learn more about controlling access to names defined
in objects and classes.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="anchor-7"></a>Defining classes in unconventional places</h2>
<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]</p>
<p>We normally define classes in modules, and often a module does nothing but
define just one class (although some define multiple, related classes). Other
modules define lots of functions. All such modules are called library modules
(not scripts) because they typically don't run code themselves, but we import
them to gain access to the names (of classes and functions) that they define.
(If they do run code, it is inside the code if __module__ == '__main__': and
often the code there allows us to test the class or module).</p>
<p>We can declare a class in a function and call the function to return an object
constructed from the class (and even use the returned object if we know 
its defined instance variables or methods).</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>

</pre></div>


<p>When run, this script prints the following.</p>
<p>&lt;__main__.f.<locals>.C object at 0x02829170&gt; 1 2</p>
<p>The first value indicates (reading the first word after the left angle-bracket,
from back to front) that class C is defined local to function f, which
is in the script we ran (named by Python to be __main__).</p>
<p>We can also declare a class in a class, and call some method in the class to
return an object constructed from the inner class (and even use the object if
we know its defined instance variables or methods).</p>
<p>class C:
        def <strong>init</strong>(self,x,y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y
        class Cinner:

            def double  (self)  :  return 2*self.val<br />
        def identity(self)   : return (self.x, self.y)
        def x<em>construct(self): return C.Cinner(self.x)

<p>When run this script prints:
      &lt;<strong>main</strong>.C object at 0x02A36310&gt;
      &lt;<strong>main</strong>.C.Cinner object at 0x02A36290&gt;
      &lt;<strong>main</strong>.C.Cinner object at 0x02A36E70&gt;
      (1, 2) 2 4</p>
<p>z.x_construct() returns a reference to an instance of class C.Cinner, that was
initialized by the x parameter in the __init__ method. When we call a.double(),
the double method defined in Cinner() returns twice the value it was
initialized with.</p>
<p>In fact, instead of the x_construct and y_construct functions, we could define
a more general construct function that takes either 'x' or 'y as arguments and
constructs an object for self.x or self.y. The first way to do this uses the
parameter (matching 'x' or 'y') as a key to access __dict__</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>def construct(self,which): return C.Cinner(self.\_\_dict\_\_[which])
</pre></div>


<p>The second way to do this uses the eval function, whose argument is either
'self.x' or 'self.y' depdending on the value of which.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>def construct(self,which): return C.Cinner(eval(&#39;self.&#39;+which))
</pre></div>


<hr />
<h2><a name="anchor-8"></a>Defining/Using Static Methods in Classes</h2>
<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]</p>
<p>A method defined in a class is considered "static" if it does not have a self
parameter. Sometimes it is useful to write methods in a class that have this
property. </p>
<p>For example, suppose that we wanted to declare a Point2d class for storing the
x,y coordinates for Points in 2-d space. The __init__ method would take two such
arguments. But suppose that we also wanted to create Point2d objects by
specifying polar coordinates (i.e, using a distance and angle in radians). We
could write such a class (with this static method) as follows.</p>
<p>import math</p>
<p>Class Point2d:
        def <strong>init</strong>(self,x,y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>    @staticmethod
    def from_polar(dist,angle):
        return Point2d( dist*math.cos(angle), dist*math.sin(angle) )

...more code
</pre></div>


<p>This method is preceded by @staticmethod (a decorator: we will discuss
decorators later). It is meant to be called from outside the class, to create
Point2d objects from polar coordinates. We can write calls like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Point2d</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">1.</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Point2d</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from</span>\<span class="n">_polar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">1.0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">math</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pi</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that we call Point2d.from_polar outside of the class by using the class
name Point2d and the static method name from_polar defined in that class. It
has no self parameter.</p>
<p>Likewise, suppose that we wanted to write a helper function for computing the
distance between two Point2d objects as a static method in this class. We could
write it as</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>    @staticmethod
    def _distance(x1,y1,x2,y2):
        return math.sqrt( (x1-x2)**2 + (y1-y2)**2 )

    def dist(self,another):
        return Point2d._distance(self.x, self.y, another.x, another.y)
</pre></div>


<p>Here this helper function is meant to be called only by the dist method in
this class, so we write its name with a leading underscore. Note that again we
call it using Point2d. Because of FEOOP, we could also call this helper as
self._distance(self.x, self.y, another.x, another.y) because type(self) is
Point2d. Because it is static, the call does not put self as the first argument.</p>
<p>Finally, we could also write this helper function as a global function defined
outside Point2d, in the module that Point2d is defined in. But it is better to
minimize any kinds of global names; so, it is better to define this name inside
the class. In this way it won't conflict with any other name the importing
module has defined.</p>
