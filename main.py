"""
 Script to convert Professor Richard Pattis' ICS-33 notes into a slightly more readable and/or colorful format.  This is accomplished by converting his text notes into Markdown, and then rendering that Markdown into HTML.  A few bits of raw HTML are also added, too.

 Project structure:
 - main.py - High level function calls
 - pretty.py - Contains the main script for "prettifying" one .txt file
 - pretty_helper.py - Contains all of the functions that do the real work

 Feel free to add and expand this script!  There are at least a few edge cases which it does not yet handle, such as more advanced detection of code blocks and inline code, and some diagrams.
